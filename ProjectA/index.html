                <p>In the depths of the ocean, there exists a sunken city known as R'lyeh, shrouded in darkness and enigma. Within this submerged citadel, slumbers an ancient and malevolent entity of cosmic proportions - Cthulhu. Its form, a grotesque amalgamation of tentacles and dread, exudes an aura of unfathomable power and malevolence. Legend tells of another ancient deity, Lylis, who possesses a mysterious eye that peers into the depths of existence itself. However, the use of this eye is not without consequence, for those who seek its forbidden knowledge often find themselves ensnared in a web of dread and despair.</p>

                So far, we know that Cthulhu Lylis, my unique creation, combines the enigmatic traits of both Cthulhu and Lylis's eye. Unlike the conventional portrayal of Cthulhu, Cthulhu Lylis exhibits a surprising degree of amiability, often found in a state of slumber reminiscent of its mythical namesake. However, when humans approach, its instinctual urge to intrude upon the human psyche emerges, instilling feelings of despair and chaos. Despite this, Lylis's eye, an integral part of Cthulhu Lylis's being, holds the potential for redemption in moments of dire need, albeit with uncertain consequences.
                <br>
                <span class="yellow">When you are already in the City of R'lyeh, Cthulhu's tentacles are bound to encroach you spirit. You can wake up the Lylis' eye and control its direction to help yourself out, but the consequence is undiscovered yet. There is another way which you can ask him to "sleep", and this is the best way to escape this city!
